      <p class = "space">The moon jellyfish, or moon jelly, is found throughout the world's oceans. Around the size of a plate, it is recognisable by the four circles visible through the translucent white bell. These four circles are gonads, the reproductive organs located at the bottom of the stomach, and they are normally purple in colour.</p>

      <h3 class = "boxbox space cushion">Box Jellyfish</h3>
      <p class = "space">Box jellyfish (class Cubozoa) are cnidarian invertebrates distinguished by their box-like (i.e. cube-shaped) body. Some species of box jellyfish produce potent venom delivered by contact with their tentacles. Stings from some species, including Chironex fleckeri, Carukia barnesi, Malo kingi, and a few others, are extremely painful and often fatal to humans.</p><br>

      <p class = "space">The comb jelly is a beautiful, oval-shaped animal with eight rows of tiny comblike plates that it beats to move itself through the water.</p>
