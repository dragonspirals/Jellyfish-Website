      <h3 class = "boxbox space cushion">Jellyfish are 95% water</h3>
      <p class = "space">Only 5% of a jellyfish's body is made of solid matter.</p>
      <br>
      <h3 class = "boxbox space cushion">Jellyfish do not have bones, brains, lungs, blood or a heart</h3>
      <p class = "space">Jellyfish have a basic nervous system, and a digestive system, but not much else</p>
      <br>
      <h3 class = "boxbox space cushion">Some Jellyfish can age backwards!</h3>
      <p class = "space">The hydrozoan Turritopsis dohrnii, an animal about 4.5 millimetres wide and tall (likely making it smaller than the nail on your little finger), can actually reverse its life cycle. It has been dubbed the immortal jellyfish.</p>
      <h3 class = "boxbox space cushion">A jellyfish's mouth is also their anus</h3>
      <p class = "space">Okay, this is a bit misleading as jellyfish don't technically have a mouth or anus. They instead have one opening that both ingests and discards waste</p>
